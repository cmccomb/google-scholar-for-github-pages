# Google Scholar for GitHub Pages
This is a Jekyll include file that pulls from a Google Scholar csv file to output and format your references. Using it is pretty simple!
1. Download your Google Scholar publications in a csv. Make sure you get all of them. 
2. Upload that csv file to the `_data/` directory of your site directory and make sure its named `citations.csv`.
3. Download the `publications` include file from this repository ([here](https://github.com/cmccomb/google-scholar-for-github-pages/blob/main/_includes/publications)).
4. Upload that file to the `_includes/` directory of your site.
5. That's it! You can see some usage examples and documentation [here](https://cmccomb.com/google-scholar-for-github-pages/).

This is similar to [Jekyll Scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar), but since this is a pure Liquid solution it works seamlessly with Github Pages!
